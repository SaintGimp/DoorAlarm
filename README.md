# Door Alarm
This is a project for monitoring the open/closed status of a door, displaying that status on a remote monitor, sounding an alarm when the door opens, and logging historical data.

## Software
There are two code projects intended to be used with the Particle Workbench, targeting one of the Particle line of IoT boards.  The Sensor project operates the door sensor (typically a magnetic reed switch) and the Monitor project operates the remote monitor that displays the door status and sounds an alarm when the door is opened.

## Hardware
The hardware was built by hand on perf board so there are no PCB design files at this time.
